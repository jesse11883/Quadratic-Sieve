# A python implementation of the Quadratic Sieve algorithm 
  -The [Quadratic Sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_sieve) is designed to factor very large numbers to break the famous [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) scheme
  -My algorithm uses [Tonelli-shanks algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonelli%E2%80%93Shanks_algorithm), [Dixon's factorization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixon%27s_factorization_method), [Fermat's factorization method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_factorization_method) and many more theorms that are too long to list.
  -I also used [A Fast Algorithm for Gaussian Elimination over GF (2)](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/factoring/fastgauss.pdf) by ÇETIN K. KOÇ AND SARATH N. ARACHCHIGE
