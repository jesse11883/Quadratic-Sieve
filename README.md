# A python implementation of the Quadratic Sieve algorithm 
  -The [Quadratic Sieve] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_sieve) is designed to factor very large numbers to break the famous RSA scheme
  -The algorithm is uses Tonelli-shanks algorithm, Dixon's factorization method, Fermat's factorization method, and Gaussian elimination
  
  to successfully factor up to 52-bit integers in under 5 minutes.
